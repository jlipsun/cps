DESCRIPTION:

The Customer Portal System (CPS) is a system that has different functions for the customers of QTC. QTC frequently acquires new customers, Customers will be using this system to submit requests, review pending requests, receive email alerts for updates, upload pertinent documents, and download final documents. There are different ways in which a customer can upload documents into the site, such as FTP and site upload. The file types can also vary from XML to excel spreadsheets. QTC acquires new customers fairly often, and they find themselves in the need of providing these new customers with their own line of business with a customer page that suits their needs. Time is not always on QTC’s side hence the need of system such as CPS. The Main purpose of CPS is to make the process of providing new customers with their own portal in the least amount of time with the greatest ease yet maintain the high quality that customers expect from QTC. The provided portal will make customers’ interaction with the respective entities faster and easier.
